summary of the content of the article:
The article is mainly about third-party genetic genealogy organizations and companies, which have the potential risk of compromised data and impersonations. Such companies provide DNA testing results for people to find their potential ancestors or relatives, and compare DNA sequences to others. However, researchers have found several vulnerable system functions in those third-party genetic genealogy databases. Malicious actors could misuse the function of genetic sequence comparison to extract a specific person's sensitive biometric genetic markers or use others' genetic markers to forge relative relationships. This security risk shades the future for genetic information usage of property security. The research team creates fake genetic data from multiple anonymous profiles and uses one-to-one comparisons to match specific genetic sequences. Additionally, the specific genetic sequences lead the malicious actors to find whether the target's gene tends to mutate to be susceptible to a potential disease. For legal, medical, and mental health reasons, personal genetic digital information should be properly protected.

The ethical issue around online genetic genealogy is the privacy and security of personal biometric data for commercial use with or without consent. The utilitarian approach may argue that the end to identifying and connecting potential relatives is beneficial to people, especially for finding missing children. But the greater good may be impaired for malicious actors such as adversaries or opposite countries could exploit the online genetic database to match the potential weakness of specific ethnic groups. Moreover, genetic information is not only privacy for people themselves but for whole ethnic groups. Specific people may consent to the use of their genetic information for genetic genealogy, but their relatives and ethnic groups may not. The detectives use immature genetic clues to identify the potential suspect may violate the privacy of people for people tend to be suspects just because of similar genetic sequences. The total benefits of online genetic genealogy are far less than its potential destruction unless the security of the personal biometric data is guaranteed.

The ethical issue about the security of online genetic genealogy is not handled for the company is aware of the risk and has started resolving it, but for now, the fix is just in discussion between scientists and policymakers. For the greater common good as utilitarianism suggests, the online genetic genealogy company should immediately stop exposing the specific generic sequences because it could cause personal biometric information and potential genetic weakness of specific ethnic groups to leak. The online genetic genealogy company could only disclose the rank of similarity between the genetic sequences, which approach may assure the connection to potential relatives and balance the security issue. Additionally, the company must research an algorithm to identify the generated gene information. Such forged gene information should be recorded and reported, and the security employee should scrutinize the applicant's profile to decide whether to ban the account. Moreover, the genetic data should be rendered anonymous unless it is an authenticated case of the relative connecting. Commercial use such as private detectives searching for genetic clues should be banned for users' privacy concerns and national security concerns. Online genetic genealogy is raising significant legal and ethical challenges in the personal biometric information domain. Besides the convenience of matching genetic sequences, we should weigh the security and privacy of the genetic information of the whole ethnic group highly. It is essential for the prosperity and safety of the ethnic group whose genetic information data are online.
