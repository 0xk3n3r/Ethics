Summary of the content of the article:
The article introduces the robots which could follow orders and execute almost autonomously, created by the US Army. Before autonomous robots were invented, the initial robots could be implemented for inspections and bomb disposal under human control.  The new autonomous robots attached to software that uses machine intelligence could understand verbal instructions. A creator of autonomous robots claims that the robot could be able to carry out complex missions and enormously reduce human sacrifice in close combat as encountering a road full of IEDs. The autonomous robots recently passed the test of manipulation skills, mobility over obstacles, and ability to follow verbal instructions. The robots' function of recognizing objects using deep learning techniques to identify objects, and even be aware of the key points of them. To follow the instructions, a bunch of detailed information and prior knowledge are hand-coded in the robots' system. Moreover, autonomous robots could question ambiguous orders and ask for more specific instructions.

Several ethical issues surrounding autonomous military robots, come along with their invention. Autonomous military robots seem unethical because people assign lethal decision-making to robots, and their attributes of lack of humanity as compassion, and mercy sound formidable. Indeed such an effective merciless killing machine abandons human deficiencies such as fatigue, broken, or mental illness, but it may lead to war crimes by selectively genecide. However, from a utilitarian perspective, the implementation of autonomous military robots profoundly reduces the suffering and harm of soldiers, and they can accomplish tasks more efficiently and accurately, which could fulfill the objectives during war. But the benefits of autonomous military robots are on both sides, the antagonists also could use the techniques to minimize their risk and inflict casualties on us. Additionally, the artificial intelligence algorithms of autonomous military robots may have flaws that could be hacked and manipulated by malicious actors, and the recognition system of robots may easily be tricked, falsely identifying targets, or demobilized by electronic interference. It is an ethical dilemma that for the nation's security every country is harsh to research autonomous technology in case of tramp by others.

The ethical dilemma caused by autonomous military robots is far from handled, for every nation that has the ability to research autonomous weapon techniques is participating in the arms race. The remedy may be to reach a common sense that hand-code some humanity attribute to autonomous military robots. The most urgent algorithm must be instructing robots to identify soldiers and civilians. As a kind of cyber soldier, robots must be restrained by the Geneva Convention and be careful of committing war crimes. Additionally, the government must enhance the security and verification of instructions taken by autonomous robots. The antagonists may exploit the vulnerability of robots' systems to implement counterattacks, and malicious actors may steal autonomous military techniques for crime or terrorist actions. Such techniques are appealing to terrorists because autonomous weapons attacks are safe for themselves and difficult to trace. So all nations should be cautious of autonomous military techniques leak. Moreover, electronic interference techniques to counterattack the autonomous military robots are necessary. Public places and high-security areas should be aware of autonomous military robots infiltrating and take precautions to paralyze the robots. With the global Robot Geneva Convention and techniques to counterattack autonomous military robots, we could find an approach to harness autonomous military techniques.
