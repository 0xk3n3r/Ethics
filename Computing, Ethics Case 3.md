A summary of the content of the article:

The article is mainly about some applications of Deepfake technology and the milestones of the technology. The technology was discovered in 2018 when used to swap celebrities' faces in real porn. It was the first use of the AI algorithm in Deepfake. Since then, Deepfake technology has been prevalent in the fake video field, especially in fake pornography and fake news. But the algorithms of Deepfake also have some positive applications such as artificial humorous or mundane videos. It was used as a new form of whistleblower protection in an investigative film about the persecution of sexual minorities in Russia. MIT also works on a project to create a Deepfake Nixon who announces the different denouement of the Apollo moon landing. It shows the potential of Deepfake could bring history alive in the future. In the summer of 2020, a new specific algorithm was released that allows users to animate someone's face in another's video. That causes a play and parody trend. Some experts emphasize preventing such satire from blurring into abuse. The Deepfake technology is also used in sports ads and political campaigns. South Park also uses it to extremes that they make a satirical show of deep-faked Trump play as a consumer advocate investigates the truth of Deepfake news.

From the article, we can realize that Deepfake technology definitely causes some ethical issues. From the Deontology perspective, the abuse of people's faces may violate people's portrait rights which is a violation of basic human rights. Politicians could fake news and videos to manipulate public opinion that action is not transparent and unethical. From the Utilitarianism perspective, the total outcome of the Deepfake technology is in the commercial field, but it's destructive in every other field. The total cost of Deepfake is far more than its gain. Deepfake technology makes fake news and false testimony even more real which makes it harder to recognize and leads to poor decision making. The people whose faces are being abused may harm their mental health and fall into Internet scams. 

For the greater good of human benefits, we need urgent action by policymakers, technology companies, researchers, and people who are involved in the Internet. We need to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of Deepfake to create safer, credible online environments for the future. Technology such as predicted better methods for Deepfake will help to detect fake videos more efficiently. The Deepfake algorithms should develop a kind of digital watermark that involves timestamps and its inventors. Such technology development may cost some resources, but it is worth it. Furthermore, powerful corporations and governments should improve laws to protect the Internet ecosystem when it is in turmoil with fake videos. The well-meaning actors should work together to figure out a common law to enhance the Internet environment. The improvement of information literacy among people will enable them to judge better the fake content. At last, We should restrain ourselves from using Deepfake technology to make parody videos of others unless they consent. We should also report to the platform to remove parody videos because it is the responsibility of the platform to protect people from the infringement of people's portrait rights.
