The ethical theory among the four ethical theories that appeals to me most is utilitarianism because it is pragmatic and efficient. It is may not easy to measure the total benefit and loss, but it leaves space for debate and trade-offs. Not like deontology, utilitarianism is more dynamic and flexible. Utilitarianism is easily to fit in and transform properly in modern society. Some trade-offs made by utilitarianism benefits far outweigh the collateral damage to society, but the social cost of the trade-offs should be scrutinized. Additionally, It may be hard to find a simple metric to measure utility, especially when people have different benefits and stakes. Bentham had famously claimed a "felicific calculus" scale to objectively compare all benefits and losses, which has factors such as intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty, proximity, fecundity, purity, and extent. But such a scale obviously does not tackle the technical problem. At least, utilitarianism leads to a practical way to solve some ethical problems by putting all cards on the table.
Utilitarianism is an attractive approach that provides a clear and practical method to the problem, but the way that "ends justify the means" logic may cause danger in the future. It may be hard to recognize the chain reaction of the consequences. A positive consequence for now may lead to a miserable future, and people always short-vision. A lot of important decisions made by humans in history are inconsistent, biased, and phenomenally terrible. Sometimes deontologists who stick to moral rules and obligations like duty and courage may lead the human being to a brighter future.
Utilitarianism is also could be misused by the authority that claims to represent the majority. The authority may exploit people's trust and put their interests first. They could control the information and claim false calculations that lead people to sacrifice the public interest. Anyone opposite to them is expendable. The malicious utilitarian authority could end in authoritarianism and dictatorship.

From the utilitarian perspective, the use of recommender systems to keep suggesting more musical content and advertisements on YouTube may be unethical, for only platforms could benefit from the recommender systems. The platform always places its profits over ensuring the public interest, but the users may involuntarily accept the credibility of the recommendation system. The recommender systems tend to build a "rabbit hole" to keep the audience. The recommender algorithm deliberately delivers personalized recommendations that are arbitrarily sent to users that they did not intend to watch, which impairs the interest of the users. Users may not interested in music content but the platform keeps sending them just like spam. Besides, some minority music bands may hardly seen by users because the algorithm keeps recommending the mainstream content. The other Youtubers may also lose potential subscriptions.
Moreover, YouTube itself is the largest video repository on the internet, its recommendation system may shape people's views, and people who want to seek entertainment would forced to watch music videos and advertisements without other choice. The use of a recommendation algorithm restricts users to control their own experience and freedom to choose on the platform. YouTube uses its market dominance to control commercial advertisements on the internet. Dominate companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by dumping advertisements and musical content on users. This kind of recommendation system is harmful to free markets.
In conclusion, the recommender systems arbitrarily send users content that they do not seek causes more damage than benefits. YouTube exploits both advertising companies and users with its dominance. The only winner in this game is the platform. All the other actors such as users, advertising companies, and music bands are trapped in the recommendation systems. Such recommender systems stiffer the user's free will and Youtubers' creativity. At least, the recommender algorithm should consider the interests of a variety of others.


Internet Companies Prepare to Fight the ‘Deepfake’ Future
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/technology/tech-companies-deepfakes.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_191125?campaign_id=2&instance_id=14077&segment_id=19073&user_id=16ecf3987642ea9959b524420f653d1e&regi_id=177540761125
From the article, we can realize the astonishing fact that Deepfake technology has been prevalent in the fake video field, especially in fake pornography and fake news. The Deepfake technology definitely causes some ethical issues. From the Deontology perspective, the abuse of people's faces may violate people's portrait rights which is a violation of basic human rights. Politicians could fake news and videos to manipulate public opinion that action is not transparent and unethical. From the Utilitarianism perspective, the total outcome of the Deepfake technology is in the commercial field, but it's destructive in every other field. The total cost of Deepfake is far more than its gain. Deepfake technology makes fake news and false testimony even more real which makes it harder to recognize and leads to poor decision making. The people whose faces are being abused may harm their mental health and fall into Internet scams. For the greater good of human benefits, we need urgent action by policymakers, technology companies, researchers, and people who are involved in the Internet. We need to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of Deepfake to create safer, credible online environments for the future.

Surgeon General Warns That Social Media May Harm Children and Adolescents
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/health/surgeon-general-social-media-mental-health.html?campaign_id=2&emc=edit_th_20230524&instance_id=93337&nl=todaysheadlines&regi_id=17754076&segment_id=133753&user_id=16ecf3987642ea9959b524420f653d1e
According to the article, the most compelling thing must be the fact that the impact of social media on youth mental health is so extensive and permanent. The ethical issue around social media is its impact on youth who are exposed to harmful content on the platform. Modern social media may offer children and adolescents some benefits but also pose a risk of harm to their mental health and well-being. Modern social media indeed helps adolescents feel more accepted according to the article, but it also shows the relationship between social media use and poor sleep quality, reduced sleep duration, sleep difficulties, and depression among youth. Social media's interest as a company conflicts with the mental health of adolescents. The critical stage in brain development makes adolescents more vulnerable, and such damage caused by social media will make our society's values toxic in the future. We should maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of social media platforms.

I do not think the "Right to be Forgotten" should apply in my nation because it may impair the "right to know" since the authority already has so much power to conceal the information. The "right to be forgotten" in my nation may end in authority deleting and burying every dark past or secret. The "right to be forgotten" policy would be misused. For now, we could not search for information about the ruling class, we may even not find any information about the lowest bureaucracy, after the policy was implemented.
According to my previous opinion, I do think some nations should not accept the "right to be forgotten" policy, but it varies in different countries. The history and the status quo of the nation decide whether it could or couldn't apply the policy. Nations such as Europe countries may accept and implement the policy scruticly. But in corrupt countries or authoritarian countries, the government may exploit the policy to blockade and regulate any information that may undermine their power.
The basis of my opinion is practical implications according to utilitarianism. Since information is the essential foundation for inclusive knowledge societies, the "right to know" is a critical right for people to survive and thrive. A healthy and well-functioned society needs transparency and the flow of information. Information being buried would be less useful and violate the public interest. If the “right to be forgotten” policy could be implemented, it would benefit specific individuals. But the truth is that good intent may not lead to a good end. The authorities or malicious actors could misuse the policy to rewrite any records they want. Such implementation is permanent and unrecoverable. The “right to be forgotten” policy uses the formal justice means to a wrong end. The policy maximizes the specific individual's interests and minimizes the public interest. The total benefit of the policy is far less from the stake of the information it destroys.
