Summary of the content of the article:
The article discusses the possibility of autonomous vehicles becoming the prey of hackers, arguing that hacked autonomous trucks could under controlled by adversarial machine learning algorithms. Autonomous vehicles focus on solving the problem of collision avoidance or navigation, but the authentic threat could be malicious actors who are trying to misuse autonomous vehicles to commit crimes. The main technique the malicious actors use is the adversarial machine learning algorithm. For now, the attack targeting autonomous vehicles has not happened, but the hackers are already infiltrating commerce platforms when they thrive. If hackers have found that attacking autonomous vehicles is profitable, they could take action. After some hackers already demonstrated the vulnerability of the CAN bus system which has no concept of authentication, fixing is responded by automakers. But the reaction may be too late to implement. The complex machine-learning algorithms that autonomous vehicles rely on could be defeated by deliberate turbulence, just like face recognition algorithms that could be misleading by impersonating a target person.

The ethical issue around the autonomous vehicles commercialized by automakers is they do not fully understand the machine learning autonomous system algorithms which leads to vulnerabilities of the vehicles. The automakers commercialized the products they could not comprehensively control, which is unethical and irresponsible. Additionally, they turn blind to the possible risks and only respond when the risk is exposed. Many physical perturbations could interfere with delicate autonomous vehicles' algorithms, such as sensor attacks with beams of light, overwhelming object detection systems, back-end malicious activity, and adversarial machine learning attacks presented in training data or the physical world. The vulnerabilities of autonomous vehicles could profoundly threaten public security and set specific people in danger. However, if automakers are prohibited from deploying autonomous vehicles commercially, they could lose possible precious data to enhance the autonomous vehicles. The policymakers must thoroughly balance the pros and cons of commercialized autonomous vehicles, trying to advance the autonomous vehicles technology and assure public security.

The ethical issue of commercialized autonomous vehicles is not resolved properly. From the utilitarian perspective, policymakers and governments acquiesce to the implementation of commercializing autonomous vehicles without scrutinizing automakers. The reason for such a conspiracy of silence could be the prolific market of autonomous vehicles, and the promising autonomous techniques domine. Autonomous vehicles indeed have a mount of benefits, which could drive more efficiently and accurately, and free people from tedious routines like commuting. To genuinely benefit from such a promising technique, policymakers and governments should enhance the robustness of autonomous vehicles' algorithms. Immune the autonomous vehicles' algorithms to adversarial machine learning algorithms by training with large amounts of noise data and protect the black box of the core algorithms' security. Moreover, the automakers should enhance the hardware of autonomous vehicles, making physical attacks such as sensor attacks ineffective. Additionally, policymakers and the government should enact laws and regulations for autonomous vehicles. Prohibit immature autonomous vehicles from being commercialized. And every autonomous vehicle should be scrutinized by technical experts before they are put into the market. According to the measure above, human society could benefit from commercialized autonomous vehicles and boost the autonomous vehicles' domain improvement. Meanwhile, the government could minimize the risk to protect the public interest.
