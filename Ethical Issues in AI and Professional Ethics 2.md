summary of the content of the article:
The article is mainly about a recognition software used in Detroit's surveillance program that could return false matches at a higher rate for darker-skinned citizens than white-skinned people. A computer scientist argues that the algorithm applied different accuracy according to their groups. The Detriot Board of Police Commissioners has two facial recognition items on their agenda, one is applied to new traffic light cameras which is already approved, and the other is called a comprehensive acceptable policy for facial recognition.  Some social activists gathered in the city church to express their concerns about algorithmic bias and the interest of black residents. However, some residents approve the facial recognition technology and argue that the camera is beneficial to prevent crimes. Residents in Detriot are also concerned that the police would go further by using such techniques to identify anyone arbitrarily. The Detroit police stress that facial recognition indeed helped lead to arrests and is critical for ensuring public safety, and the policy specifies that facial recognition will only used to investigate violent crimes or under extraordinary circumstances.

The facial recognition algorithm causes an ethical issue about racial discrimination. The algorithm indeed improves the security of society and benefits law enforcement by identifying the suspect more efficiently. The authority also uses the data only by the interior staff and under severe circumstances such as identifying violent criminals or finding missing persons. Such application of facial recognition algorithm seems to benefit far outweigh the collateral damage. However, the algorithm may be replicating and even amplifying human biases toward racial groups. Furthermore, racial discrimination could be reinforced and perpetuated by algorithms. It may amplify the social mobility and racial inequalities problems, eventually impairing society and causing social fragmentation. Additionally, the facial recognition algorithm application could violate personal privacy because it is personal biometric information. Even if law enforcement argues that they use the data under the strict policy, hackers or other malicious actors may breach the database to misuse the information. Law enforcement may exploit people's concern about safety to amass more power which leads to mass surveillance.

The ethical issue around facial recognition algorithms is not being solved properly for now. Law enforcement may enhance the policy of accessing the database and the system, but they have not taken the problem of systemically biased algorithms. The inaccuracy recognition algorithm may cause errors in incrimination. If malicious actors recognize the flaw in the facial recognition system, they could take advantage of the flaw by identity theft. The more error algorithms were made, the more probability the system would be hacked. The training data of the facial recognition algorithm should be collected carefully without dirty data, and double-checked by experts. The data feed to the algorithm should be complete, balanced, and selected appropriately. The test of the algorithm before it is in the field must be approved by randomly selected users and civil society groups, and the feedback mechanisms should be built. Additionally, law enforcement should enhance the security of the database in case of a breach of the system. This must incorporate a trade-off between data efficiency and data security. The access to the database and the system must be highly protected, and the use of the system must be approved and recorded by the official. Any abuse of the facial recognition system should be scrutinized by law enforcement. In conclusion. Such precautions may solve the ethical and technical problems caused by the facial recognition algorithm partially. We must rein the tech but not stifle the innovation.
