The first ethical issue is about surveillance tasks assigned to a friend of mine who works in the cyber department of law enforcement. Their new group targets minority ethnic groups, and the team includes some recruited ethnic linguists for real-time surveillance tasks. The whole project initially is for the mass surveillance of potential terrorists, but artificial intelligence is not capable of recognizing the slang and abbreviations in talks, not to mention minority languages. So the project relies on civil servants in law enforcement. Additionally, such surveillance tasks' techniques and environment are considered top secrets, so the out-source of the project is not being considered. The extent of the surveillance is so massive that every region has to establish its special group to perform the tasks. The member of the group is scrutinized and selected inside law enforcement. The members of law enforcement who meet the conditions are so few that they have to work two shifts for twenty-four hours to implement surveillance. Their superior government often abuses the power to assign some tasks to trace dissidents such as demobilized soldiers who seek pensions and residents who petition. The whistleblower of the surveillance project said many of them felt depressed and stressed because of the unethical tasks, and he found an opportunity to relocate to a field service successfully to leave for a year.

The whole project to implement mass surveillance on minority ethnic groups is unethical, not to mention the project's target on other dissent groups eventually. The members of the group turned to depression and other mental stress for the tasks they had performed. Additionally, few of them rejoiced about the technique and the power they had and secret surveillance on people they were interested in. Moreover, the superior governors themselves self are the potential bad factor for them abusing the government power to trample the privacy of every single person who lives in the country. The technique they use to surveil specific people is provided by giant technology companies, and the government itself cannot scrutinize the security of the system. So a potential backdoor may exist because of the out-source of the whole system. The project claimed that the initial purpose was to monitor potential terrorist groups' plans. The database they access is also unethical because it is provided by some mainstream real-time communication software. The technology company that owns the software once announced that they had never kept the chat records of the users, which is dishonest and deceptive to the public. The surveillance project prioritizes the specific interests of its governors which is to monitor and eliminate all threats to their power. The technologies of the system are disgusting and morally unpermissible in any context and are harmful and unethical to the ordinary. Why ordinary? Some audacious and curious investigators indeed use the monitor system to find out what the dignitaries are talking about, and the system immediately records it and reports to the superior of the project. Such audacious investigators are rotting in prison now. So the surveillance system indeed has a white list and censorship models, only for dignitaries.

The second ethical issue is about the sexism and bullying in the cyber department of law enforcement. The whole surveillance team members are predominately male because the superior of the department insists that women are unsuitable for the technique job and they should return home to take care of their housework. The only woman on the team is a veteran who comes from a powerful military family. Even relying on her strong background, she could never get promoted. The promotion not only requires the ability and endeavor to the tasks which often means late shift or all night jobs but also acting properly in the colleague banquets which are predominately organized in night clubs and brothels. According to the requirements of such activities, the promotion opportunities of women in law enforcement are naturally excluded and subtly eliminated.

The rank position and opportunities of women in cyber law enforcement are astonishingly low, and the gender composition of the tier-one department is dominated by the absolute men circle. So it is not weird that the promotion and selection of the front-line operators is gender biased. Such a homogeneous group could not allow challenging voices and tramped around in public affairs. Gender bias is the surface of the iceberg, inside law enforcement is a highly autocratic homogeneous circle. The toxic mainstream ethnic male cyber law enforcement group who have a similar background and the same hobbies could arbitrarily monitor any ordinary even stifle the public to death. They may also allow the women to join the team but only as mascots and could not touch any powerful realm of the only men's circle. They eliminate the female at the first step, then maybe someone who is different from the mainstream.

The two ethical problems around the mass surveillance program are systematically unethical and technically illegal. The whole program could not be allowed to talk publicly but indeed has been approved by the highest authority. They even create a white list for themself. The solution could strictly restrict surveillance in private areas and be consented to people unless they were identified as terrorists. People who are wrongly surveillance should be compensated. But it does not resolve the benefits mystery of the whole distorted program, for the true terrorists have no probability of discussing their horrible plans in the mainstream communication platform. The only ones who are monitored are the unaware ordinary people who may talk about their jobs, dreams, and family plans. The real benefit of the mass surveillance program is to identify potential dissidents and mark them in the system. As for gender bias, it is part of the bias bureaucracy promotion game. Unless the selection and promotion system has changed the bias will not end. The public and conscientious civil servants should stand in front and seek change and rein the unrestrained cyber law enforcement which coerces the technical company to design the system and provide private data. They may also reject the main communication platform and turn to an encryption communication platform like the authentic terrorists if they are aware of such a mass surveillance program running and unstoppable.
