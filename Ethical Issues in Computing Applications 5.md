Summary of the content of the article:
The first article is mainly about whether artificial intelligence threatens people's job opportunities. The authors discuss the consequences of the question from two aspects, economic and political. It argues that new technologies could enable people to reduce work time while staying productive. That improvement could leave people free time to devote to their hobbies and community service, even pursue new careers. Nowadays, robots and machine learning could improve productivity which seems to benefit the living conditions of people. But people, including blue- and white-collar workers are concerned about unemployable and income inequality. Additionally, unemployment in the country may be closely related to authoritarianism and permanent income inequality. Even small increases in unemployment have outsized political impact.

The second article is about the threat of job automation which could most impact blue-collar workers who perform repetitive work. The article claims that a new finding shows holders of bachelor’s degrees would be more exposed to artificial intelligence than workers with only a high school degree. That implies instead of blue-collar workers, white-collar workers may affected more by job automation because of what their jobs are exactly artificial intelligence good with. However, researchers also reassure people that artificial intelligence tends to complement people in those jobs rather than replace them, and we should pay more attention to blue-collar workers who are stuck in tremendous work.

What you found most interesting about the articles:
The most interesting thing about the first article must be the profound implications that come from the turbulence of unemployment. The unemployment caused by automated machines which hugely impact the workers, could divide the society and lead to far more inequalities. Streamlining autonomous machines initially liberates workers from mundane and repetitive tasks but ends in damaging people's job opportunities and lowering their incomes. Eventually, it gaped the ordinary people with rich people and caused deep inequality among them.

The most interesting thing about the second article is that automation is authetically taking our jobs, but mainly takes the jobs of white-collar workers. The article makes a strong argument that artificial intelligence is born with numeracy skills and perceiving talent that excels human beings. So the endangered workers are white-collar workers. The white-collar workers seem to fight in areas where artificial intelligence is domine, and the best way out may be collaboration with artificial intelligence.

One ethical issue related to one of the articles:
The ethical issue related to the first article is while artificial intelligence creates abundance and wealth in human society, the super-rich individuals reap the all benefits and leave ordinary people to suffer in poverty and low-income jobs. From the Deontology perspective, this reflects the society's embedded systemic inequality and unethical. The super-rich individuals have the responsibility to make sure others do not suffer because of the artificial intelligence they created and compensate people whose job is substituted by autonomous machines. From the utilitarian perspective, the divergence in incomes may cause societal turbulence and desperate people to become radical, eventually destructive to the benefit of the whole society. Ordinary people lack a share in the bounty of artificial intelligence improvement and face a decline in job security and standards. The only people who benefit are dignitaries, but if the highly divided country falls into turmoil even they could hardly be unscathed. To solve this ethical issue, policymakers and governments should mitigate social gaps, improve working conditions, and navigate job transitions.
